		<h1>Computer Refresh Notice</h1>
		<p>The computer you are currently using has reached the end of its useful life and needs to be replaced or updated. This is to ensure that all devices are up to date with the latest technology, software, and security features.</p>
		<p>When a computer is due for refresh, it means that it has become outdated and may no longer meet the demands of your work or may even pose a security risk to your data. For instance, the computer may no longer receive critical software updates or security patches, making it vulnerable to malware and other cyber threats. Additionally, an outdated computer may not be able to handle newer software applications and may cause slowdowns or other performance issues.</p>
		<p>To address this issue, you need to <strong>Contact your local IT department</strong> to request a replacement or upgrade for your computer. They will assess your needs and provide you with a new device that is up-to-date, faster, and more secure, helping you to work more efficiently and safely.</p>
		<p><strong>It is important to act on this message promptly, as continuing to use an outdated computer may put your work and data at risk.</strong></p>
